How to execute the 3 different Visibility Graph implementations?

1. Unzip project_01.zip file
2. Navigate to folder project_01 inside Matlab
3. Execute file main.m

main.m will execute all 3 versions of Visibility Graph for all 3 maps, and output the following data. It will also display pictures for each map and version of Visibility Graph showing the obstacles, edges, and path.

>> main
